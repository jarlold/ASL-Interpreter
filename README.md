In 2023 my former classmate oZep created an ASL reader using OpenCV, that's
really cool and probably has all sorts of implications for people who know
and/or need ASL but I'm here to solve a more pressing and important matter.<br><br>

Sometimes when I'm eating food and watching cartoons I can't hit the space bar
without getting my keyboard dirty. (see *figure 1* below)<br><br>

I think it should be obvious to anyone that my problems are much more severe and
deserve way more attention than people with small inconveniences such as not
being able to speak or hear other people speak.<br><br>

Yet somehow, our unjust society has allowed my plight to continue unaided. Until
now.
